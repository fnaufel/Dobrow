# Introduction and review

## Deterministic and Stochastic Models

### Example 1.2 (SIR model) {-}

::: {.rmdbox latex=1}

* $S_t = {}$ number of [susceptible]{.hl} people at time $t$.

* $I_t = {}$ number of [newly infected]{.hl} people at time $t$.

* $R_t = {}$ number of [recovered]{.hl} people at time $t$.

* $z = {}$ probability that a [susceptible]{.hl} individual [becomes infected]{.hl} once in contact with an infected person.

* Assume every susceptible person comes in contact with every infected person.

:::

* Probability $p$ that a susceptible individual becomes infected at a point in time:

  $$
  p_t = 1 - (1 - z)^{I_{t-1}}
  $$

  ::: {.rmdwarning latex=1}
  
  The book has the exponent as $I_{t}$, but the correct exponent is $I_{t - 1}$.
  
  In this discrete time model, we compute the number of newly infected people as a function of the number of people infected at the previous time step.
  
  :::
  

* This is because $(1 - z)^{I_{t - 1}}$ is the probability that the person has contact with all $I_{t-1}$ infected people and [does not become infected]{.hl}.

* The number of newly infected people $I_{t}$ follows a binomial distribution with $n = S_{t-1}$ and probability of success $p_t$:

  $$
  I_{t} \sim \text{Bin}(S_{t-1}, p_t)
  $$
  
  so the PMF is
  
  $$
  P(I_{t} = k) = \binom{S_{t-1}}{k} \; p_t^k \; (1 - p_t)^{S_{t-1} - k}
  $$
  
* Then the number of susceptible people at time $t$ is 

  $$
  S_{t} = S_{t-1} - I_{t}
  $$

* This simplified example does not take into account the transition from infected to recovered. 

* $I_t$ is the number of *newly* infected people at time $t$.

* In the computation, only newly infected people are contagious. It's as if people remain infected and contagious for one time step only.

## What is a stochastic process?

### Example 1.6 (Random walk and gambler's ruin) {-}

```{r echo=FALSE}
sim_ruin <- function(k, n, p, plays) {
  
  results <- vector('integer', plays + 1)
  results[1] <- k
  results[2:(plays + 1)] <- 
    sample(c(1, -1), plays, replace = TRUE, prob = c(p, 1 - p))
  
  results <- cumsum(results)
  last <- match(TRUE, results == 0 | results == n)
  
  if (!is.na(last))
    results[(last + 1):(plays + 1)] <- NA
  
  results
  
}
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot_ruin <- function(k, n, p, plays, nsims) {
  
  graphs <- vector('list', nsims)

  for (i in 1:nsims) {
    
    graphs[[i]] <-
      tibble(gain = sim_ruin(k, n, p, plays)) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = 1:length(gain), y = gain)) +
        geom_line() +
        geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed') +
        geom_hline(yintercept = n, linetype = 'dashed') +
        labs(
          x = NULL,
          y = NULL
        )
  }
  
  final <- wrap_plots(graphs, ncol = 3) +
    plot_annotation(
      title = TeX(
        paste0(
          'Gambler\'s ruin:  $k = {}$', k,
          ',  $n = {}$', n,
          ',  $p = {}$', p %>% round(2)
        )
      ),
      theme = theme(
        plot.background = element_rect(color = 'black'),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5),
        plot.margin = margin(20, 5, 5, 5)
      )

## Monte Carlo simulation

* No notes for now.

* But @wagaman-2021-probab has a good chapter on Monte Carlo simulation.


## Conditional probabilities

### Example 1.10 (Gambler's ruin) {-}

::: {.rmdbox latex=1}

* $k = {}$ initial amount of money player A has.

* $n = {}$ total amount of money, so player B starts with $n - k$.

* $p = {}$ the probability that A wins a round.

* $q = {}$ the probability that B wins a round, so $q = 1 - p$.

* $p_k = {}$ the probability that player A wins, if A starts with $k$. [This is what we want to find.]{.hl}

:::
  
* The book only considers the case where $p = q = 1/2$.

* A more general analysis is found in @JosephK.Blitzstein989.

* A link about solving recurrent equations: http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs2223/d98/notes/recurrence/solve/solve.html

* Conditioning on the first step:

  $$
  p_k = p_{k+1} \cdot p \;+\; p_{k-1} \cdot q
  $$
  
* This recurrence has characteristic equation

  $$
  px^2 - x + q = 0
  $$
  
* The roots of this equation are

  $$
  x = \frac qp \quad \text{and}\quad x = 1
  $$
  
* If $p \neq q$ (i.e., A and B have different probabilities of winning a round), these roots will be distinct, so

  $$
  p_k = A \cdot 1^k + B \left( \frac qp \right)^k = 
  A + B \left( \frac qp \right)^k
  $$
  
* To find $A$ and $B$, we consider the boundary conditions:

  $$
  p_0 = 0 \quad \text{and}\quad p_n = 1
  $$

  ::: {.rmdnote latex=1}
  
  These values correspond to $p_k$ being the probability of A winning when he starts from $k$.
    
  Note that [this is the first time]{.hl} in our reasoning [where we have to decide if $p_k$ is the probability of A winning or the probability of A losing]{.hl} when he starts from $k$.
    
  If we switch the values of $p_0$ and $p_n$, then we are computing $p_k$ as the probability of A losing when he starts from $k$.
    
  The recurrence is the same (because the situation is symmetric), with only the boundary conditions being different.
  
  :::

* We finally get

  $$
  A = \frac{1}{1 - \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^n}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  B = -A
  $$
  
* So, [when $p \neq q$,]{.hl}

  $$
  p_k = \frac{1 - \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^k}
  {1 - \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^n}
  $$
  
* If $p = q$ (i.e., A and B have the same probability of winning a round), both roots will be equal to $1,$ so

  $$
  p_k = A \cdot 1^k+ B \cdot k \cdot 1^k = A + Bk
  $$

* Using the boundary conditions, we get, [when $p = q$,]{.hl}

  $$
  p_k = \frac k n
  $$

* To summarize, the probability $p_k$ that A wins starting from $k$ is

  $$
  p_k = 
  \begin{cases}
  \frac{1 - \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^k}
  {1 - \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^n} &\text{ if } p \neq q \\
  \frac k n  &\text{ if } p = q 
  \end{cases}
  $$


### Example 1.12 (Choosing integers) {-}

::: {.rmdbox latex=1}

* $X \sim \text{DUnif}(1, 100)$.

* $Y \sim \text{DUnif}(1, X)$.

* Find $P(Y = y \mid X = x)$.

:::

* $P(Y = y \mid X = x) = 1/x$, for $y \in \{1, \ldots, x \}$.


### Example 1.13 (Joint, marginal, conditional) {-}

::: {.rmdbox latex=1}

* [Joint]{.hl} distribution: 

  $$
  P(X = x, Y = y) = \frac{x + y}{18} \quad\text{ for }\quad (x, y) \in \{0, 1, 2\} \times \{0, 1, 2\}
  $$

* Find the [conditional]{.hl} $P(Y = y \mid X = x)$.

:::

* The conditional will be 

  $$
  P(Y = y \mid X = x) = \frac{P(X = x, Y = y)}{P(X = x)}
  $$

* To find $P(X = x)$ --- the [marginal]{.hl} distribution of $X$:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  P(X = x) &= \sum_{y \in \{0, 1, 2\}} P(X = x, Y = y) \\
  &= P(X = x, Y = 0) + P(X = x, Y = 1) + P(X = x, Y = 2) \\
  &= \frac{x + x + 1 + x + 2}{18} \\
  &= \frac{x + 1}{6}
  \end{aligned}
  $$

* Now

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  P(Y = y \mid X = x) 
  &= \frac{P(X = x, Y = y)}{P(X = x)} \\
  &= \frac{\frac{x + y}{18}}{\frac{x + 1}{6}} \\
  &= \frac{x + y}{3(x + 1)}
  \end{aligned}
  $$


### Example 1.15 (Continuous RVs) {-}

::: {.rmdbox latex=1}

* Joint density

  $$
  f(x, y) = e^{-x} \quad \text{for}\quad 0 < y < x < \infty
  $$

* Find $P(Y < 2 \mid X = 5)$.

:::

* Just for fun, here is an [interactive]{.hl} graph of $f(x, y) = e^{-x}$ in part of this domain:

    ```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
    library(rgl)
    setupKnitr(autoprint = TRUE)
    
    persp3d(
      function(x, y) { 
        ifelse(y < x, exp(-x), NA)
      },
      xlim = c(0, 3),
      ylim = c(0, 3),
      col = 'blue',
      alpha = .6,
      zlab = ''
    )
    ```
